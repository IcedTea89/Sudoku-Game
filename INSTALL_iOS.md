# 📱 Install Sudoku on iPhone/iPad (No Mac or Xcode Required!)

This guide shows you how to install the Sudoku game as an app on your iOS device **directly** without needing a Mac or Xcode.

## ✨ Method: Progressive Web App (PWA)

Your Sudoku game can be installed as a PWA - it works like a native app but installs through Safari!

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Host the File

You have 3 options:

#### **Option A: Use GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free & Easy)**

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in (or create a free account)
2. Click **"New Repository"**
   - Name: `sudoku-game`
   - Check "Public"
   - Click **"Create repository"**
3. Click **"uploading an existing file"**
4. Drag and drop these 3 files:
   - `sudoku-pwa.html`
   - `manifest.json`
   - `sw.js`
5. Click **"Commit changes"**
6. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
7. Under "Source", select **"main branch"** → Click **Save**
8. Wait 1-2 minutes, then your app will be at:
   ```
   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/sudoku-game/sudoku-pwa.html
   ```

#### **Option B: Use a Simple Web Server**

If you have access to any web hosting (like Netlify, Vercel, or your own server):
1. Upload the 3 files (`sudoku-pwa.html`, `manifest.json`, `sw.js`)
2. Access the URL where `sudoku-pwa.html` is hosted

#### **Option C: Local Testing (WiFi network)**

1. On Windows, run:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\clarence.lack
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   (Or use any local web server)

2. Find your computer's IP address:
   ```powershell
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

3. On your iPhone, go to:
   ```
   http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:8000/sudoku-pwa.html
   ```

### Step 2: Install on iPhone/iPad

2. **Navigate to your hosted URL** (from Step 1)

3. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow pointing up) at the bottom

4. **Scroll down** and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**

5. **Customize the name** (or keep "Sudoku")

6. **Tap "Add"** in the top right

7. **Done!** 🎉 The Sudoku app icon will appear on your home screen!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" option not showing?
- Make sure you're using **Safari** (not Chrome or other browsers)
- iOS only supports PWA installation through Safari

### App doesn't work offline?
- Make sure the files are properly hosted on a server
- Direct file:// access doesn't support service workers

### Icon not showing?
- The app uses a generated icon
- You can customize it by creating a proper icon file

### Want to update the app?
- Just update the hosted files
- Users will get the update when they reopen the app

- `sudoku-pwa.html` - The app itself
- `manifest.json` - App configuration
- `sw.js` - Service worker for offline support

**To install on iPhone:**
1. Host these files somewhere (GitHub Pages is easiest)
2. Open the URL in Safari on your iPhone
3. Tap Share → "Add to Home Screen"
4. Enjoy your Sudoku app! 🎉
